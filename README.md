# Number Guessing Game

A simple guessing game made with JavaScript. Tells you your previous guesses, lets you see if you were too low or too high and gives option to reset game. Building this, I learned how:
* to better build an interactive back end
* to use the focus() method
* how to disable certain content
* how to create a new element in a JS function (reset button)
* that I can use querySelector to select certain elements in a div (script.js line 59)
